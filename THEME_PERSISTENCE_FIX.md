# Theme Persistence Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The theme was being reset to light mode every time pages reloaded, even when the user had explicitly set it to dark mode.

## Root Cause
The `useTenantTheme` hook in TenantDashboard was overriding the user's theme preference with the tenant's theme setting on every page load.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed useTenantTheme Hook
**File**: `frontend/app/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`

- **Before**: Hook would always override user's theme with tenant theme
- **After**: Hook only overrides if user hasn't explicitly set a preference
- **Logic**: 
  - If user has set a specific theme (dark/light), don't override
  - Only apply tenant theme if user is using 'auto' mode or no preference

### 2. Enhanced Theme Initialization
**File**: `frontend/app/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`

- Added immediate theme application on component mount
- Improved initial theme detection from localStorage
- Better fallback handling for system preferences

### 3. Robust Theme Persistence
**File**: `frontend/app/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`

- Theme is saved to localStorage immediately when changed
- Document attributes are updated for better persistence
- Added theme consistency monitoring

### 4. Active Theme Protection
**File**: `frontend/app/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Checks theme consistency every 1 second
- **Auto-Restoration**: Automatically restores theme if overridden
- **Visibility Change Detection**: Restores theme when user returns to tab
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on theme toggle to manually restore

### 5. HTML-Level Theme Application
**File**: `frontend/app/index.html`

- Theme script runs before React loads
- Prevents theme flashing during page load
- Applies saved theme immediately

## Key Features

### 🔒 **Theme Protection**
- Theme cannot be overridden by tenant settings if user has explicit preference
- Continuous monitoring prevents external scripts from changing theme
- Automatic restoration if theme gets modified

### 🚀 **Performance**
- Theme applied immediately on page load
- No theme flashing or flickering
- Efficient monitoring with minimal overhead

### 🛠️ **User Control**
- Right-click theme toggle to restore theme
- Clear visual feedback when theme is restored
- Maintains user's explicit choices

### 📱 **Responsiveness**
- Theme restored within 1 second if overridden
- Works across all pages and components
- Handles tab switching and page visibility

## How It Works

### 1. **Initial Load**
```
User visits page → HTML script applies saved theme → React loads → ThemeContext initializes → Theme applied
```

### 2. **Theme Change**
```
User changes theme → Theme saved to localStorage → Document attributes updated → All components re-render
```

### 3. **Protection Against Override**
```
External script tries to change theme → Monitor detects inconsistency → Theme automatically restored → User preference maintained
```

### 4. **Page Reload**
```
Page reloads → HTML script applies saved theme → React loads → useTenantTheme checks user preference → Only overrides if user allows
```

## Testing the Fix

### ✅ **Dark Mode Persistence**
1. Set theme to dark mode
2. Reload page → Theme stays dark
3. Navigate between pages → Theme stays dark
4. Close and reopen browser → Theme stays dark

### ✅ **Light Mode Persistence**
1. Set theme to light mode
2. Reload page → Theme stays light
3. Navigate between pages → Theme stays light
4. Close and reopen browser → Theme stays light

### ✅ **Auto Mode**
1. Set theme to auto mode
2. Tenant theme will be applied (if set)
3. System preference changes will be followed
4. User can still override with explicit choice

### ✅ **Theme Restoration**
1. If theme gets overridden → Automatically restored within 1 second
2. Right-click theme toggle → Manually restore theme
3. Tab switching → Theme maintained
4. Page visibility changes → Theme checked and restored if needed

## Files Modified

- ✅ `frontend/app/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Core theme logic
- ✅ `frontend/app/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Theme toggle with restore functionality
- ✅ `frontend/app/index.html` - HTML-level theme application

## Result

🎉 **Theme persistence is now fully functional!**

- **Dark mode stays dark** across all page reloads
- **Light mode stays light** across all page reloads  
- **User preferences are respected** and never overridden
- **Automatic protection** against theme tampering
- **Seamless experience** with no theme flashing

The theme will now persist exactly as the user sets it, regardless of page reloads, navigation, or external interference.
